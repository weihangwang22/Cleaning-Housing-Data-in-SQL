## Cleaning Housing Data in SQL

In this project, I used SQL to clean a Nashville housing dataset containing information on housing units, their owners, and their characteristics. Using SQL queries and statements, I cleaned the dataset by identifying and handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicate and irrelevant information. I also created new variables by splitting existing ones to provide insights into the housing market in Nashville.
